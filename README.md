The website for the [Electronic Gaming League](http://egl.ninja) at [Ball State 
University](http://cms.bsu.edu).  It is developed in Symfony and [will pull](#pre-release-stage)

## Goals

There are a few goals for the website:

  - Transition from Ball State's iWeb servers. (Done)
  - Make development history of the website available to future webmasters (GitHub, etc)
  - Simplify simple maintenance tasks, such as adding news, and make it accessible to all officers
  - Provide useful services to members

## Pre-Release stage

This website is not currently not released to the public, but it is possible to participate in
development and view changes on http://beta2.egl.ninja.  If you are interested in participating,

During development of main features, the website will be developed directly on the Master branch.
